# Mock Up Web Journaling Application Concept 

Mock-up design for daily journaling application with drawable entries for Ipad pencil. This is just a concept to design a layout and mess with different UI decisions. This is nothing serious other than Graphical concpet design and some simple post commands to handle journal entries and displaying them on home page 

### Motivation 
I thought that there was a gap for a guided jouranlying app to get people into the routine for actually taking on journaling which I thought this was a good idea. I wanted to also create an application to utilize my IPad and my Apple Pencil to actually journal as if I was writing down on pager and having my entries stored. I decided to go on the route of making my entries through an app over a web application.
